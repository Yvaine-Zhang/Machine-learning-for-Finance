# Machine-learning-for-Finance

Machine learning application in finance (Python, sklearn, TensorFlow)


•  Given a dataset of customers who have applied for credit, and each customer is associated with some number of attributes, and a rating of being a Good/Bad credit risk; Applied KNN, SVM and Boosting models on credit card default detection, analyzed confusion matrix, ROC and learning curve  


• Construct machine learning models, such as Neutral Network and Ensemble models that use features derived from market observables, to predict price direction in future periods; Assess the models using 10-sec as well as 1-min aggregation periods
